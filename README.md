## Flower Classification with TPUs

There are over **5,000** species of mammals, **10,000** species of birds, **30,000** species of fish – and astonishingly, over **400,000** different types of flowers. In this competition, we are challenged to build a machine learning model that identifies the type of flowers in a dataset of images over 104 types.

## Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)

TPUs are powerful hardware accelerators specialized in deep learning tasks. They were developed and first used by **Google** to process **large image databases**. This competition is designed to give TPUs a try.


## Data Description

Images are provided in **TFRecord** format, a container format frequently used in Tensorflow to group data files for optimal training performace. Each file contains the id, label and img.


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/IbrahimSobh/kaggleFlowerClassificationTPUs/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
